Imagine a rally, but instead of following a single, predetermined route, you have a bit more freedom and a lot more head-scratching to do! You need to visit as many locations as possible before the finish time (usually about 30-60 minutes before last orders at the finish pub).

Here's the gist:

**What it is:**

A navigational scatter is a type of road rally where the emphasis is on **accurate navigation** rather than outright speed. Unlike stage rallies where you race against the clock on closed roads, scatters take place on public roads and require you to adhere to all traffic laws.

The "scatter" part refers to the fact that you're given a series of **clues or instructions** that define a number of **control points** (think of them as waypoints) that you need to visit. However, these points aren't necessarily in a linear order, and you might have some flexibility in _how_ you get between them. You often have to "scatter" your way around the area to find and visit all the required points within a given time limit.

**Key Elements:**

- **Crew:** You'll typically have two people in the car:
  - **Driver:** Responsible for driving safely and legally, and following the navigator's instructions.
  - **Navigator (or Co-driver):** This is the brains of the operation! They decipher the clues, plot the route, keep track of time, and tell the driver where to go.
- **Navigation Instructions:** This is where the fun (and frustration!) begins. Instead of a simple map, you'll be given a variety of cryptic instructions, which might include:
  - **Map References:** Grid references from Ordnance Survey (OS) maps are very common. You'll need an OS map (usually 1:50,000 "Landranger" series) and a Romer to plot these accurately.
  - **"Tulips" or "Junction Diagrams":** Simple line drawings showing a junction and indicating the direction to take.
  - **HEROs (Historical Enduro Rally Organisation) or FCRs (Fore-and-Aft Road sections):** Specific types of cryptic road book instructions that require careful interpretation.
  - **Spotting Features:** Instructions like "turn left at the red telephone box," or "visit the church with the green spire."
  - **Grid Reference Sequences:** You might be given a long list of grid references to plot and connect.
- **Control Points (C.P.s):** These are the locations you need to visit. Usually, you have to answer a question about the location you can only answer by being there. They might also be:
  - **Manned Controls:** Where an event marshal will stamp your time card or record your arrival.
  - **Unmanned Controls (or "Code Boards"):** A small board with a unique letter or number code that you have to write down on your time card to prove you visited.
  - **Passage Controls:** Simply a point you must drive _past_ to complete a section.
- **Time Keeping:** You'll have a target time to complete each section or the entire event.
- **Penalties:** Penalties may be given for:
  - Missing control points.
  - Arriving early or late at controls.
  - Incorrectly recording code board details.
  - Taking an incorrect route (if the instructions are prescriptive).
  - Traffic infringements (very serious!).
- **Equipment:** Beyond your car, you'll definitely need:
  - **Ordnance Survey Maps:** Essential for plotting and navigating.
  - **Romer:** A small plastic or metal tool for accurately plotting grid references on a map.
  - **Stopwatches:** For precise timekeeping.
  - **Clipboards, pens, highlighters:** For managing your route and notes. Most people use cardboard for holding maps and paper for safety in an accident.
  - **A good torch:** For evening events.

**Why are they popular?**

- **Accessibility:** You can use a standard road car (though a reliable, comfortable one is best). You don't need a specially prepared rally car.
- **Skill-based:** It's a mental challenge! It tests your navigational skills, problem-solving, teamwork, and time management.
- **Social:** They're often very friendly events, and a great way to meet people who share an interest in cars and navigation. Many evening events finish at a pub for a social afterwards.
- **Beautiful Scenery:** Scatters often take you through lovely parts of the UK countryside that you might not otherwise explore.
- **Affordable:** Compared to other forms of motorsport, scatters are relatively inexpensive to enter.

**In essence, a navigational scatter is like a treasure hunt on wheels, where the "treasure" is the satisfaction of correctly interpreting complex clues and finding all the control points within the allotted time, all while enjoying the journey through the British countryside.**

If you're interested in getting involved, look for local motor clubs in the UK that run navigational rallies or historic rallies. They often have beginner-friendly events and experienced members who are happy to share their knowledge.
