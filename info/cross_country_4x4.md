For a newcomer to UK motorsport, "Cross Country" is an exciting and diverse off-road discipline that combines elements of rallying and trials. Imagine tackling challenging terrain in purpose-built vehicles, testing both driving skill and vehicle robustness.

Here's a breakdown of what it involves:

**What is it?**

- **Off-road focus:** Unlike circuit racing, Cross Country events take place entirely on private land, away from public roads. This means rough tracks, steep banks, mud, water, and various other natural obstacles.
- **Variety of formats:** Cross Country isn't just one type of event; it encompasses several formats:
  - **Competitive Safaris/Hill Rallies:** These are most similar to traditional rallying, where competitors complete timed runs over a course, with the winner having the lowest aggregate time penalty. Courses can be up to 10 miles long, and vehicles tackle them multiple times.
  - **Trials (Tyro, RTV, CCV/Modified Trials):** These events focus more on precision and control than outright speed. Courses, called "sections," are marked out by gates or cones. The aim is to navigate through the section without stopping, touching markers, or incurring penalties. The further you get without mistakes, the better your score. Speeds are low, and there's no time limit, but momentum must be maintained.
  - **Orienteering/Navigation events:** These can include treasure hunts, point-to-point events, or winch challenges, where the emphasis is on navigation and finding specific locations.

**What kind of vehicles are used?**

- Generally, **four-wheel-drive (4x4) vehicles** are essential to cope with the demanding terrain.
- The type of vehicle can vary depending on the event:
  - **Tyro Trials** are designed for standard production 4x4 cars that are road legal (taxed, MOT'd, insured).
  - **More competitive events** like Competitive Safaris often feature highly modified 4x4s, including purpose-built vehicles and even UTVs (Utility Task Vehicles) or "Cross Cars" (small, off-road buggies often powered by motorbike engines).
- Vehicles must comply with Motorsport UK regulations for safety and eligibility.

**How do you get involved?**

- **Join a local club:** This is the best first step. Clubs organise events and can offer advice and guidance.
- **Get a licence:** You'll need an RS Clubman competition licence from Motorsport UK for most Cross Country events (which is free). For higher-level competitions, an RS Interclub licence or higher may be required.
- **Vehicle:** While specialised vehicles exist, you can start in a relatively standard 4x4 for events like Tyro trials.
- **Equipment:** Beyond your vehicle, you'll need suitable clothing (natural fibres, full limb coverage), good shoes/boots, and waterproofs. Helmets are required for all timed events.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Off-road challenge:** It's all about tackling difficult natural terrain.
- **Skill over pure speed:** While speed is important in Safaris, precision, vehicle control, and navigation are paramount in many Cross Country formats.
- **Accessibility:** Many events are designed for newcomers, with lower entry barriers than some other motorsport disciplines. Drivers as young as 13 can participate in some events, often with an experienced passenger.
- **Community:** Cross Country motorsport in the UK often has a strong club-based community, making it a social and welcoming environment.

In essence, Cross Country in UK motorsport is about getting your 4x4 dirty and testing your driving abilities against challenging off-road conditions, whether that's against the clock or through precise navigation.
