A "12 car navigational rally" is an excellent and affordable entry point into UK motorsport, particularly for newcomers. Here's a breakdown of what it involves:

**What it is:**

* **Navigational Challenge, Not Speed:** Unlike stage rallies where you're racing against the clock on closed roads, 12 car rallies focus on precision navigation and timekeeping on public roads. The objective is to follow a defined route and arrive at various control points exactly on time, maintaining a set average speed (typically a maximum of 30 mph).
* **Team Event:** You compete as a two-person crew: a **driver** and a **navigator**.
* **Limited Entry:** The "12 car" in the name refers to the maximum number of competing vehicles allowed. This limit exists because events with more than 12 cars require more extensive permissions and road closure regulations under the Road Traffic Act. Keeping it at 12 or fewer allows for simpler, more accessible events.
* **Road Legal Cars:** You use your standard road car, with no special modifications needed. Your car just needs a valid MOT, tax, and insurance.
* **Social & Accessible:** These rallies are often run by local motor clubs, usually in the evening, and have a strong social element. They are designed to be a fun, low-cost way to get into rallying.

**How it works:**

1.  **Preparation:**
    * **Crew:** Find a driver or navigator to team up with.
    * **Licence:** Both driver and navigator will need an RS Clubman licence from Motorsport UK (the governing body for four-wheel motorsport in the UK). This is free and can be applied for online, even on the day of the event, although you really should do it earlier!
    * **Club Membership:** You'll need to be a member of the organising motor club.
    * **Equipment:** Essential equipment for the navigator includes Ordnance Survey Landranger (1:50,000 scale) maps (the specific ones for the event will be noted in the regulations), a pencil and rubber for plotting, and a good watch or clock. A "romer" (a plastic scale for plotting grid references) is also very useful. A map light is essential for night events.
    * **Car Check:** Ensure your car is road legal and complies with any specific regulations for the event (e.g., limits on forward-facing lights, exhaust noise).

2.  **The Event:**
    * **Route Instructions:** The navigator receives a series of instructions defining the route. These can vary in complexity depending on the class (novice, intermediate, expert) and can include grid references, map features, or basic turn instructions. Sometimes, the instructions are given out section by section at control points ("plot 'n' bash").
    * **Navigation:** The navigator's job is to accurately interpret these instructions, plot the route on the map, and guide the driver.
    * **Time Controls:** The route is divided into sections with specified time allowances, usually based on an average speed of no more than 30 mph. You'll encounter "time controls" where marshals will note your arrival time.
    * **Penalties:** Penalties are given for arriving too early or too late at time controls, for not visiting "passage controls" (which might be code boards or manned checks), or for taking the wrong route. The aim is to accrue the fewest penalties.
    * **Secret Checks:** To ensure competitors are following the correct route, there are often "secret checks" or "code boards" along the way that you must record.
    * **Driving:** The driver's role is to drive smoothly, follow the navigator's instructions precisely, and maintain the correct average speed. Safety and adherence to the Highway Code are paramount, as these events take place on public roads.

**Why it's great for newcomers:**

* **Low Cost:** Compared to other forms of motorsport, 12 car rallies are very affordable.
* **Uses Your Own Car:** No need for a specially prepared rally car.
* **Focus on Skill, Not Speed:** It's about mental agility, teamwork, and precision, rather than outright speed, making it less intimidating.
* **Develops Core Skills:** It teaches fundamental rallying skills like map reading, timekeeping, and teamwork, which are transferable to other motorsport disciplines like road rallies and even stage rallies.
* **Sociable Atmosphere:** Local clubs are generally very welcoming to new participants and offer guidance and support.

If you're interested in getting started, look for local motor clubs in your area â€“ many regularly organise 12 car rallies and have classes specifically for beginners.
